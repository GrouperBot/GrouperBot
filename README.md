# GrouperBot
A discord bot whose focus is centered around the idea that no gamer should play alone. In the world of discord, with hundreds of thousands of users to play with, there's just no reason for that to happen.

This bot was created to solve that issue by connecting gamers to each other and to encourage people to make new friends on Discord! We believe this is in the spirit of why Discord was created and would like to help make that process easier!
