# GrouperBot
A discord bot whose focus is centered around the idea that no gamer should play alone. In the world of discord, with hundreds of thousands of users to play with, there's just no reason for that to happen.

This bot was created to solve that issue by connecting gamers to each other and to encourage people to make new friends on Discord! We believe this is in the spirit of why Discord was created and would like to help make that process easier!

## ðŸ“£ Usage
Don't forget to prepend the prefix infront!
- `help` - A tidy help menu which displays all available commands.
- `groups <tag1,tag2,...>` - Shows a list of advertisement that match the supplied tags.
- `group new <tag1,..> <number of players needed> <description>` - Creates a new advertisement for when you need a group!
- `tags` - Shows all available tags to use!

If you and a buddy wanted 3 more players to join you in some Overwatch quickplay games, you could write:

`;group new overwatch 3 Looking for 3 more players to join us in some quickplay matches! Add me as a friend and lets play!`

The advertisment will appear like so:

`;groups overwatch`
