# GrouperBot
A discord bot whose focus is centered around the idea that no gamer should play alone. In the world of discord, with hundreds of thousands of users to play with, there's just no reason for it.

This bot was created for that sole purpose, connecting gamers to each other and allowing people to make new friends. We believe this is inline with the overall theme of Discord, which is why we've created this bot for `Discord Hack Week`.
